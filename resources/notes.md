# NOTES

## Index
- Introduction
	- Building a DiscoGAN
		- Learning to Discover Cross-Domain Relations with Generative Adversarial Networks [Paper]
	- Brief thought
		- 6 neural networks
		- Why Tensorflow?
	- Style transfer isn't what we want
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9reHvktowLY (good example)
	- Cross-domain relations are natural to us humans
	- How can I make money?
		- Hard visualization - Create - Videogames
- Doing things in the right way
	- two images data sets
	- create an image from 2 data sets
	- conditional image generation
	- What is the real problem?
		- incoder - decoder (standar GAN)
		- 2 incoder - decoder (GAN reconstruction loss)
		- Adversarial context networks
			- trained together simultaneously
- Let's get our hands dirty
- We should have done it right
- Great ideas
- Q & A
- Resources
